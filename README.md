# Bibscrap
Small script which generates a .txt file suitable for using it as a .bib for $\LATEX$.

What do u need?
* Gecko driver https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases.
* A .txt file with the same format as dois.txt:
  - First line with the atributes you wanna add to your $\LATEX$ bibliography, separated by commas.
  - Following lines with the DOIs of the bibliography you used.

This script is intended for unix based and firefox systems but it is usable in windows by using a different driver.
